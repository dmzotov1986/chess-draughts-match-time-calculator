Parameters allowed to be real decimal values not only integers. Type commands and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> (not legal recognized command - for exit from program): `help` - repeat this help message, parameter name (`p`, `t`, `n`, `v`, `m`, `s`) - recalculate named parameter from values of other parameters, parameter name followed by `=` and value (decimal, real or integer) - reset this parameter to this new value. Examples: `p`<kbd>Enter</kbd>, `v=15`<kbd>Enter</kbd>, `help`<kbd>Enter</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>."
